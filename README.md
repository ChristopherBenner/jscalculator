# jscalculator
This calculator was created as the final project in the Foundations Course of the Odin Project.<br>
This project uses a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to deliver a functioning calculator.<br><br>

Throughout this project, I learned how to get keyboard events, use JavaScript objects, and how to use HTML codes to deliver better design features such as the division symbol.<br><br>
This calculator gives you the options of the basic functions of add, subtract, multiply, and divide as well as a dedicated button to make numbers negative, a square root button, and a percent button. These are in addition to the memory buttons which give basic memory capabilities.
